# **App Name**: Acme Store Reimagined

## Core Features:

- UI Rendering: Display a pixel-perfect, high-fidelity clone of the ACME STORE e-commerce page UI.
- Dark Mode: Render a dark mode interface using Tailwind CSS.
- Responsiveness: Implement responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Icon Integration: Use Heroicons for the search and cart icons.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue badge (#0070f3) for price highlights, adding a vibrant focal point against the dark background.
- Background color: Black (#000000) for the main background, creating a stark and modern aesthetic.
- Accent color: Dark Gray (#1F2937 - equivalent to bg-gray-800 and bg-gray-900 from Tailwind) to provide subtle contrast and depth to elements like the Navbar and Footer.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable UI. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Maintain a fixed Navbar at the top with a height of 16 units (h-16).
- Use a grid layout for product cards with specified column counts for different screen sizes.
- Footer must be aligned to the bottom of the page, with button and Vercel description at the bottom right.
